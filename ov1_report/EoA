    The assignment was a good introduction to using the EFM32GG board. The 
compendium was easy to follow and made the task rather trivial. However the use 
of the reference manual was tedious, as it was not always easy to look up the 
information you actually needed. As an example we tried to find out how you 
returned from the interrupt handler, looked at the quick reference and tried to 
find the instruction there, but was unable to do so. You may be able to find it 
in the 900 page reference manual, but trying to search through that manual for a 
task like this should not be neccecary. In all I would say that the task itself 
is a good introduction to the course, but even though you want us to look at the 
reference manual, it should be for those things that it would be logical to look
up in the manual.
